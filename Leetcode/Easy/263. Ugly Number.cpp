An ugly number is a positive integer which does not have a prime factor other than 2, 3, and 5.

Given an integer n, return true if n is an ugly number.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 6
Output: true
Explanation: 6 = 2 × 3
Example 2:

Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: 1 has no prime factors.
Example 3:

Input: n = 14
Output: false
Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.
 

Constraints:

-231 <= n <= 231 - 1

class Solution {
public:
    bool isUgly(int num) {
        if (num == 0)
            return false;
		
		//exhaust until divide by 2
        while (num % 2 == 0)
            num /= 2;
		//exhaust until divide by 3
        while (num % 3 == 0)
            num /= 3;
		//exhaust until divide by 5
        while (num % 5 == 0)
            num /= 5;

        return num == 1; //when last number is 1, then it is  complete divisiable by 2/3/5
    }
};
